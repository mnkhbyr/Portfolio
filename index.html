        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am Munkhbayar Byambasuren, a passionate individual with a keen interest in both Software Engineering and International Affairs.</p>
        <p>In the year 2021, before I graduated from high school, I took a significant step in my academic journey by applying to a Chinese university, XI'AN JIAOTONG UNIVERSITY. I was fortunate to receive a full scholarship, which opened up new opportunities for me. However, my plans evolved, and I decided to enroll in the Foreign Affairs major at the NATIONAL UNIVERSITY OF MONGOLIA.</p>
        <p>My academic journey reflects my diverse interests and commitment to continuous learning. The intersection of software engineering and international affairs is where I find my passion. I believe in the power of technology to address global challenges and contribute to a better world.</p>
        <p>Throughout my journey, I have been involved in various projects that showcase my technical skills and dedication. From experimenting with sound frequencies to generate artistic images to exploring the complexities of international relations, I am always eager to explore new horizons.</p>
        <p>Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to explore my projects, and if you have any questions or opportunities, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect and create something meaningful together!</p>
